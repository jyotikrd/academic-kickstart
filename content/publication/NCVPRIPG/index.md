abstract: This paper presents a novel method for discovery and recognition of hairstyles in a collection of colored face images. We propose the use of Agglomerative clustering for automatic discovery of distinct hairstyles. Our method proposes automated approach for generation of hair, background and face-skin probability-masks for different hairstyle category without requiring manual annotation. The probability-masks based density estimates are subsequently applied for recognizing the hairstyle in a new face image. The proposed methodology has been verified with a synthetic dataset of approximately thousand images, randomly collected from the Internet.
